11-Puzzle Problem: AI solution

## Description

    I Implemented the A* search algorithm to develop an AI that solves the 11-puzzle problem.
For overview, the 11 puzzle problem is one where there is a 3x4 puzzle board with twelve tiles. 
There are eleven tiles filled with numbers from 1-11 and one tile with the number 0 (this tile 
represents the space). The goal is to rearrange the puzzle state given (start state) into the 
desired puzzle state. The sum of Manhattan distances of the tile from their goal positions was
used as the heuristic function in the A* search. Additionally, the program can use weighted search
if provided.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Install Python3
* Install ast library


### Installing

* Download file to desired local directory
* Create python3 virtual environemnt in desired local directory using following command:
```
python3 -m venv 'name'
```
* Create subdirectory where file will go
* Download file to subdirectory

### Executing program

* To run program
```
python3 AIProject.py
```
* When notified, provide start and end state in list/nested list format.
* Ex: [[2, 0, 1, 7], [3, 5, 9, 8], [6, 4, 10, 11]]
